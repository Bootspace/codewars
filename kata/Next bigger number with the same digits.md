# Next bigger number with the same digits

You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

```javascript
nextBigger(12)==21
nextBigger(513)==531
nextBigger(2017)==2071
```

If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

```javascript
nextBigger(9)==-1
nextBigger(111)==-1
nextBigger(531)==-1
```
